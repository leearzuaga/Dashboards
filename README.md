# Dashboards

I created this dashboard for part of a Governance Data Distribution project I was hired to work on. 

The purpose of the dashboard is to track the more than 2,000 alerts I personally had to send out to Advisors who worked with Schwab. When an advisor would reply to my alerts, I had to specify what queue bucket that response belonged to -- "Alert Sent" was the default queue type. While building this dashoard was not a requirement by management, I decided to create it anyways so management could visually and quickly see how effective reaching out to Advisors via Schwab's alert system was.
